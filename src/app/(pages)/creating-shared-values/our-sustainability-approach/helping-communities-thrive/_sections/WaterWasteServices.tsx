            Manila Water provides water that is compliant with water quality
            standards established by government and regulators in countries
            where we operate, safeguarding the health of over 12.7 million
            people. Importantly, there were no incidents of water quality
            violations issued by government in 2024. While we faced challenges
            in 2024, specifically with select water quality parameters, our
            overall performance demonstrates our ongoing commitment to meeting
            these standards. This is achieved through rigorous testing at
            various sample points within our treatment facilities and community
            tapping points. Our water quality is stringently monitored, and
            water samples are tested in our Department of Environment and
            Natural Resources-recognized and ISO 17025 accredited laboratories.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            To address the identified water quality issues, we are implementing
            corrective actions. These include targeted decommissioning of
            affected wells where necessary. Furthermore, we are implementing
            water safety plan, which aims to: (1) minimize source water
            contamination; (2) ensure safe water quality from treatment,
            storage, and distribution; (3) identify potential risks and
            implement appropriate control measures across all operations; (4)
            implement and document the effectiveness of identified control
            measures; and (5) provide and update relevant policies and
            procedures.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            While maintaining high service quality, our rates are regulated and
            approved. We offer additional discounts to low-income communities to
            ensure their water needs do not strain their limited resources. Our
            flagship social program, Tubig Para sa Barangay (TPSB), has provided
            water service connection to approximately 1.8 million Filipinos in
            low-income communities within Metro Manila’s East Zone since 1998.
            Complementing TPSB, the Manila Water Foundation’s Lingap Program
            improves water supply and sanitation facilities in public service
            institutions like schools, hospitals, jails, markets, and
            orphanages, reaching approximately 418,436 individuals in 2024.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            Looking ahead, we announced in 2024 an expansion of our lifeline
            beneficiary coverage, including all members of the Pantawid
            Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) whose consumption does not exceed
            20 cubic meters per month, effective January 1, 2025. This provides
            a 60 percent discount on the first 10 cubic meters and 40 percent on
            the second 10 cubic meters, translating to a discount of over P200
            for a 4Ps consumer using up to 20 cubic meters monthly. Read more

          <p>
            By the end of 2024, our collective efforts resulted in expanding
            water access to our customers through 1.3 million water service
            connections, delivering 1,287 million cubic meters (mcm) of potable
            water.

          Beyond providing water, Manila Water is committed to responsibly
          managing wastewater, ensuring its sustainable return to the
          environment. In 2024, we expanded sewer connections to 318,385 areas
          within Metro Manila’s East Zone, Boracay, Clark, Laguna, and
          developments managed by Estate Water. Notably, Boracay Water
          implemented the REGAIN program, offering free sewer connections within
          a 100-meter radius, complementing the Municipal Council’s strict Sewer
          Sanitation ordinance.
        </p>
        <p>
          For communities not yet served by sewer lines, we provide sanitation
          services through regular septic tank desludging every five to seven
          years. In 2024, we desludged 133,435 septic tanks. Regular desludging
          extends water retention time within septic tanks, preventing clogged
          plumbing and improving the preliminary removal of organic pollution
          and disease-causing pathogens. In 2024, we did not receive any
          effluent quality violations for our wastewater discharge.
