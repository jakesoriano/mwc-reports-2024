              Manila Water is committed to continuously improving service for
              its growing customer base by offering a range of convenient
              options for managing water accounts. The Manila Water App allows
              East Zone customers to check current bills, view payment history,
              and settle accounts online or through mobile wallets. Real-time
              service advisories and interruption notices are delivered via push
              notifications, and service-related concerns or inquiries can be
              submitted through the M.W. C.A.R.E.S. platform. We also maintain
              active communication with our customers through regular updates on
              social media, providing information about ongoing projects, water
              interruptions, and program activities.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-4'>
              Efficient and reliable customer service is a key performance
              indicator for Manila Water managers. Customer requests and
              complaints are promptly referred to Territory Managers for
              immediate action. To foster stronger community engagement, we hold
              quarterly gatherings with local neighborhood leaders, known as
              kasanggas. These meetings provide company updates and gather
              valuable feedback. The kasanggas act as an extension of Manila
              Water, disseminating information to their communities, clarifying
              issues, and acting as intermediaries for customers with specific
              concerns.
            </p>

              established turnaround times based on service level agreements.
