              Manila Water recognizes the escalating threat to its services from
              natural calamities, intensified by climate change. With this, our
              approach to climate resilience is anchored on our business
              continuity strategy. This prioritizes the safety and well-being of
              our employees, who are essential to maintaining operations during
              emergencies, while strengthening our organization’s resilience
              against emerging threats. Our approach begins with a comprehensive
              hazard identification and risk assessment process, evaluating each
              of Manila Water’s operational processes. This analysis allows us
              to prioritize and focus on the most critical threats to service
              delivery.

              Our primary goal is the swift restoration of water and wastewater
              services following any disruption. This customer- and
              system-focused approach recognizes the interconnectedness of our
              operations and prioritizes the most crucial elements for effective
              and rapid recovery. Beyond simply reacting to events, we actively
              anticipate potential disruptions and incorporate proactive
              measures to mitigate their impact. Specifically, our business
              continuity is designed to:

              Manila Water’s incident management protocol is guided by the “3Cs
              in Disaster Response”: Company, Customer, and Country. Employees,
              as our first line of defense, report their status to line managers
              during calamities, enabling centralized assessment and rapid
              deployment of rescue units in coordination with local government
              and partners. To maintain a state of readiness, annual
              company-wide drills simulate disaster scenarios, activating the
              incident management system and evaluating earthquake protocols and
              business continuity plans. These drills familiarize employees with
              their potential roles and responsibilities, facilitating swift

              This focus on preparedness extends to all environmental
              challenges. In 2024, when the Philippines experienced extreme
              heat, we implemented mandatory measures to protect both employees
              and contractors from heat-related illnesses. At our project sites,
              temporary facilities with shaded and well-ventilated resting
              areas, equipped with hydration stations and first aid services,
              were established. Safety officers were deployed to actively
              monitor workers’ health, particularly during peak temperature
              hours. For heat-intensive tasks, we implemented rotating shifts
              among smaller teams and provided tents to limit prolonged exposure
              to the heat. Modified work schedules, including extended lunch
              breaks and work during cooler parts of the day, were adopted at
              some project sites. Across all service areas, employees were
              advised to avoid strenuous activities and fieldwork during peak
              temperature hours.

            Prioritizing the safety and well-being of our employees and
            contractors enables us to better serve our customers, especially
            during challenging times. Our strategy for ensuring uninterrupted
            service rests on three pillars: ensuring asset resiliency,
            implementing operational controls and redundant systems, and
            developing innovations.

                We continually enhance the flood resilience of our facilities,
                particularly those located near rivers and in flood-prone areas.
                These upgrades are essential to maintaining uninterrupted
                operations, even during severe weather events. An example of
                this is the rehabilitation of the La Mesa Dam. Upgrades to its
                spillway, retaining wall, and instrumentation have strengthened
                the dam’s structure, mitigated flood risks, and improved
                monitoring capabilities, including turbidity detection. We have
                also implemented floodproofing measures, such as constructing
                additional storm drains at facilities in low- lying areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                To guarantee continuous facility operations during emergencies,
                we have established several protocols including configuring
                bypass systems, conducting regular asset integrity audits and
                inspections, automating critical processes, and establishing
                underground emergency reservoirs. We also deploy standby and
                mobile generator sets and utilize water tankering to maintain
                service during disruptions. Our water treatment plants are
                equipped with generator sets, sandbags, and dewatering pumps to
                mitigate the impacts of strong typhoons and flooding.

                Beyond our operational response, Manila Water, through its
                social development arm, the Manila Water Foundation (MWF),
                extends aid to affected communities. MWF’s Agapay: WASH in
                Emergencies program provides drinking water and deploys water
                tankers or mobile treatment plants to disaster-stricken areas.
                In 2024, the Agapay program provided 5-gallon water and hygiene
                products to 14,140 families.

                Our efforts are further strengthened by the Manila Water 503rd
                Water Service Battalion, a reserve unit of the Armed Forces of
                the Philippines. Specializing in water treatment, distribution,
                and sewage management, the battalion also supports urban search
                and rescue, disaster relief, and civil-military operations. This
                unit has been deployed multiple times beyond the East Zone,
                including during typhoons Kristine and Carina. The 503rd
                Battalion provided support through stakeholder management,
                manpower augmentation, equipment deployment, and relief
                distribution.

              <p className='mb-4'>
                To enhance our response capabilities, we have commissioned a
                diverse emergency fleet, including four mobile treatment plants,
                a mobile stage, a mobile command center, a mobile toilet, a
                mobile sleeping quarter, an amphibious vehicle, a tractor head,
                six 4x4 rescue vehicles, an ambulance, an all- terrain vehicle,
                a jet ski, three speed boats, and five folding boats.

                Our experience with COVID-19 taught us the importance of
                continuous innovation to be better prepared for future
                pandemics. Innovation is a key component of our business

                continuity strategy, driving us to explore new ways to ensure
                uninterrupted service. In response, we piloted wastewater- based
                epidemiology (WBE) for COVID-19 surveillance in Metro Manila,
                leading to the establishment of our first molecular laboratory
                at the Ilugin Sewage Treatment Plant (STP).

                This facility, equipped with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
                machines, enables us to detect and quantify emerging
                contaminants, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in wastewater.
                Supported by a grant from the Government of Austria to Asian
                Development Bank under the Accelerating Sanitation for All in
                Asia and the Pacific project, this initiative has significantly
                enhanced our capability to perform environmental surveillance
                and strengthen public health measures.
