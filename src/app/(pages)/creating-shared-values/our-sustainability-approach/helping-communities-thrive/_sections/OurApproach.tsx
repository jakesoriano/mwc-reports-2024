            Manila Water’s approach to building thriving communities centers on
            providing reliable access to safe water and sanitation services
            while prioritizing environmental sustainability and community
            engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Key practices demonstrating this include expanding access to water
            and wastewater services through infrastructure investment and
            targeted programs, achieved in close partnership with our supply
            chain. We ensure water quality and affordability through rigorous
            monitoring and lifeline rates, while promoting environmental
            stewardship via educational programs like Lakbayan and wastewater
            reuse initiatives. Community resilience is strengthened through a
            robust disaster preparedness system and relief efforts. Customer-
            centricity is prioritized through convenient digital tools and
            proactive communication channels. Finally, long-term water security
            is addressed through non-revenue water reduction, new source
            exploration, and wastewater reuse strategies.

            Manila Water recognizes the escalating challenges posed by growing
            water demand, expanding populations, climate change, and natural
            disasters. To address these issues, we have developed our water
            security plans spanning short, medium, and long-term horizons across
            all our business units. These plans encompass strategies such as
            developing new water sources, reducing non-revenue water (NRW), and
            improving our water distribution networks. In 2024, our efforts
            resulted in securing a 23% raw water buffer, enabling us to reliably
            meet our service obligations to our customers and regulators.

              Building on this foundation, 2024 saw the implementation of
              measures to augment existing supplies and secure alternative water
              sources. Drawing water from Laguna Lake, the Cardona Treatment
              Plant is now capable of producing up to 110 million liters per day
              (MLD) and is actively serving several towns in Rizal. Similarly,
              East Bay Phase 1 is harvesting raw water from the lake,
              contributing an additional 50 MLD. At the Tayabasan River in
              Antipolo City, the Calawis Water Treatment Plant is effectively
              treating river water and can produce up to 80 MLD.
            </p>
            <p>
              To further diversify our water sources, we have established vital
              alternative options. The Marikina Portable Treatment Plant,
              drawing water from the Marikina River, can produce up to 20 MLD
              when needed. Strategically located deep wells across our
              concession area can add up to 110 MLD. Furthermore, we have
              enhanced the efficiency of our backwash recovery systems at the
              East La Mesa and Balara Treatment Plants, increasing production
              from 30 MLD to 40 MLD. A third backwash recovery system is
              currently under construction at the Cardona Treatment Plant,
              further optimizing our resource utilization. This commitment to
              water source development extends across our subsidiaries. Capital
              expenditure allocations are strategically directed towards
              developing new infrastructure that reinforces water security,
              service quality, service accessibility, continuity, and regulatory
              compliance. Clark Water will continue its source development
              programs to increase the current supply by 22% and is also set to
              explore sustainable water sources and water reuse. Boracay Water
              consistently monitors the surface water levels in the Nabaoy River
              to assess and respond to changes in water availability. Calbayog
              Water recently inaugurated three critical infrastructure projects:
              the Pagbalican Pump Station and 1,500 cubic meter Reservoir
              Rehabilitation Project, the San Policarpo Booster Pump Station,
              and the San Policarpo- Pagbalican Transmission Line Project. These
              projects are expected to deliver sustained water volume and
              pressure to 5,025 households, significantly enhancing service
              delivery in the region.

              Part of our water security plans is resource efficiency, with our
              NRW reduction program as a core strategy. NRW, encompassing water
              lost through leaks, pilferage, and other unbilled uses, directly
              impacts our ability to meet service obligation. To reduce the
              volume of water loss before reaching our customers, we implemented
              the NRW reduction program across all our concessions. This program
              involves leak detection and repair, pipe replacement, and meter
              inspection and calibration. To minimize disruption and
              inconvenience to our customers, we typically conduct preventive
              maintenance activities and emergency repairs at nighttime. We also
              prioritize quickly resolving incidents by coordinating closely
              with stakeholders such as third-party contractors, national
              government agencies, local government units, and other entities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through these efforts, we have achieved significant results. By
              year-end, our enterprise NRW reached 14.6%, a substantial
              improvement compared to the World Bank’s 25% standard and a
              significant reduction from the 63% recorded at the start of our
              East Zone concession in 1997. This achievement underscores our
              commitment to minimizing water loss and maximizing resource
              utilization. Furthermore, a 1% reduction in NRW translates to
              serving an additional 80,000 customers, highlighting the tangible
              impact of our program on expanding service reach.

              Continuous improvement and expansion of our water distribution
              network forms our water security strategy. This involves
              rehabilitating, replacing, and extending our waterlines to ensure
              a reliable 24/7 water supply for our growing customer base. Our
              distribution management practices include regular preventive
              maintenance, rigorous crackdowns on illegal connections and meter
              tampering, and swift repairs of breakages to minimize disruptions.

              A significant project exemplifying our commitment to water network
              improvement is the NBAQ4 aqueduct. This initiative, undertaken in
              coordination with the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System
              (MWSS), is a key part of our improvement and expansion efforts in
              the East Zone. The new aqueduct, capable of conveying up to 1,000
              million liters of water per day (MLD), is paving the way for the
              inspection, assessment, and subsequent rehabilitation of three
              existing aqueducts, some of which have been operational since
              1929. These rehabilitations will ensure the continuous water
              supply for more than 7 million customers in the East Zone.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-6'>
              As of December 2024, we have laid and maintained approximately
              8,229 kilometers of water pipelines across our Philippine
              operations. This represents a 229% increase from the 2,497
              kilometers inherited in the East Zone in 1997. This expansion
              improves the reliability of our 24/7 water supply for customers.
              Looking ahead, we are committed to implementing service
              accessibility and continuity programs, prioritizing the extension
              of our network to reach currently unserved areas and further
              strengthening water security for all.
