        At Manila Water, we believe that building a culture of care and trust
        extends beyond our internal operations. It thrives through strong
        partnerships that foster shared responsibility and collective progress.
        We actively cultivate these relationships across various fronts,
        ensuring a sustainable and impactful presence in the communities we
        serve.

              Our flagship environmental advocacy, Toka Toka, exemplifies this
              principle. Rooted in the Filipino concept of &quot;share&quot; or &quot;stake,&quot;
              Toka Toka establishes vital partnerships with institutions and
              individuals, promoting personal accountability and environmental
              stewardship. From simple acts like waste segregation to complex
              undertakings like supporting used water projects, Toka Toka
              empowers communities to actively participate in environmental
              protection. Its success is evident in initiatives like &quot;Amot Amot
              Para Sa Malimpyong Boracay&quot; in Boracay Water, which tailors the
              Toka Toka concept to local dialects and tourism-focused
              environmental concerns. The 2024 &quot;ToKasangga&quot; event further
              strengthens these partnerships, recognizing the invaluable
              contributions of our &quot;Kasanggas&quot; (partners) and barangay achievers
              in achieving water access and sanitation for all.

            We believe that true leadership extends beyond operational
            excellence. We foster a culture of care and trust by sharing
            knowledge, driving industry best practices, and contributing to the
            broader conversation around water sustainability. By actively
            engaging in thought leadership initiatives, we aim to inspire and
