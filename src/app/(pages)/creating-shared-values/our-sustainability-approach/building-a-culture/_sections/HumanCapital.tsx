            As of December 31, 2024, we employ 2,495 employees across our
            business operations, 95% of whom are permanent employees. This
            figure reflects our current headcount following a reorganization
            that involved the transfer of ownership of two subsidiaries. This
            reorganization ensured continued employment for all affected
            employees. We are also committed to increasing female representation
            at all levels of the organization. Currently, 57% of executive
            officer positions are held by women, and female representation on
            our Board of Directors has increased to 22%.

            Our commitment to building a strong workforce extends to nurturing
            future talent. We embrace students eager to explore the water
            industry through our internship program. This initiative enriches
            our talent pipeline while fostering diversity within our teams. In
            2024, we had the privilege of hosting 69 interns from universities
            and colleges across the Philippines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond internships, our Cadetship Program offers recent college
            graduates a unique opportunity. This intensive program provides
            business training, exploring critical areas such as water systems
            management, field safety protocols, and community engagement
            strategies. The success of our previous cadet batches is evident in
            their progression to leadership roles within our organization, where
            they now lead various teams. In 2024, 9 cadets completed the 32nd
            batch of the program.

              voluntary and 6% involuntary separations. This is notably lower

              data to gain insights into employee departures and identify
              opportunities for improvement.
