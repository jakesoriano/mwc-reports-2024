              Implications on Value Creation

              <p className='mb-4'>
                The state of nature and the environment plays a critical role in
                creating value for our business. Our primary resource, natural
                capital â€“ raw water from surface or ground water sources, can
                vary in terms of quality, quantity, and availability. This
                variability directly impacts our ability to supply 24/7 water to
                the communities we serve, both now and in the long term.
              </p>
              <p className='mb-4'>
                Furthermore, the interconnectedness of nature to our business,
                including our manufactured and financial capital, highlights the
                importance of a healthy environment for our long-term success.
                By providing environmental services in the form of wastewater
                treatment, we are not only fulfilling our environmental
                responsibility but also re-investing in the natural capital of
                the communities and the country.
