            Manuchar Philippines that addresses WASH challenges in schools. In
            2024, a Water Asset Installation and Rehabilitation (WAIR) project
            was implemented for Noveleta Elementary School in Noveleta, Cavite.

            rooms. This WASH project provided students and staff with reliable
            water for improved hygiene and sanitation.
