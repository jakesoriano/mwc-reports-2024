          Empowering Communities, Drop by
Drop: The Roots to Shoots-Family Care
Center Project
          </h3>
          <p>
          In a powerful synergy of purpose, the Manila Water
Foundation joined forces with Pilipinas Shell Foundation
and Clark Development Corporation to launch the Roots
to Shoots-Family Care Center Project in Mabalacat,
Pampanga. This collaborative endeavor was born from
a shared vision: to uplift Aeta households by securing
reliable access to clean water, thereby safeguarding their
health and well-being.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className='flex-1'>
          <p className='mb-4'>
          A crucial step towards this goal was
the establishment of a deep well facility. To further bolster
the community’s water resources, static water tanks were
installed in August 2024, with the generous support
of Clark Water.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-4'>
          Recognizing the intrinsic link between Water,
Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) and overall community
flourishing, the Manila Water Foundation and its dedicated
partners extended their support through comprehensive
training sessions. These sessions focused on vital
aspects such as Food Security and Livelihood, as well as
Mother-and-Child Care, nurturing holistic well-being.
Demonstrating its commitment to sustainability,
the Manila Water Foundation spearheaded the formation
of a vibrant WASH group—a community-led leadership
council that will serve as the future stewards of their
water system. With the groundwork laid, construction of
the deep well commenced in December 2024, marking a
significant stride towards impacting five local Aeta cultural
communities, encompassing approximately
2,500 households.

          Project Planas: Cultivating Resilience
Through Water Security
          </h3>
          <p className='mb-4'>
          Another inspiring testament to collaborative impact is
Project Planas, a synergy initiative spearheaded by the
Manila Water Foundation in partnership with Prime Infra
Foundation, Inc. This project was strategically designed
to bridge critical WASH gaps within the Aeta community
of Katutubo Village, Barangay Planas in Porac, Pampanga.
The cornerstone of this initiative was the establishment
of a vital water system, directly benefiting 257
households across Sitio Kulambo, Sitio Tanag, and
Sitio Magalang.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-4'>
          Mirroring the holistic approach of other WASH
community partnerships, the Manila Water Foundation
facilitated empowering capacity-building activities.
These sessions equipped community members with
the essential knowledge and skills to effectively operate
and maintain their newly established water system.
Notably, the WASH Group members, predominantly
comprised of determined Aeta women, have embraced the responsibility of leading the management and
operations of this vital facility. The project also benefited
from the invaluable support of the Filipino Catholic
religious congregation of the Religious of the Virgin Mary
(RVM), who graciously granted permission for the use
of the land where the deep well was constructed. The
Barangay Local Government of Planas further bolstered
the project through supportive policy development and
ongoing management.
          </p>
          <p>
          A significant milestone was reached in October 2024,
when the Katutubo Village water system was energized,
now drawing an impressive 300,000 liters of water per
day. To ensure the highest standards of water quality,
a conventional water treatment system was installed,
guaranteeing compliance with the stringent Philippine
National Standards for Drinking Water (PNSWD).
Furthermore, a power reliability function was integrated
to ensure a consistent and dependable water supply for
the community, fostering greater resilience and wellbeing.

            Manila Water Foundation, in partnership with the MWSS,
inaugurated family toilets in Sitio Sapang Munti, within
the Ipo Watershed in Norzagaray, Bulacan in November
2024. Thirty (30) sanitation facilities now serve over 500
adults and children living in the Ipo Watershed. The safe
and secure toilets are a vital step in eliminating open
defecation, protecting the environment, and upholding
the dignity of families, particularly young girls.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-4'>
            The handover of the family toilets followed the

            <p className='mb-4'>
            At the handover event, the WASH Group of community

intends to ensure the preservation and sustainability of
the critical watersheds that are vital to water security.
