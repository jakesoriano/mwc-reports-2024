            Manila Water Foundation, with support from valued partners, empower
            rural communities in their journey towards improved water access,
            sanitation and hygiene or WASH. In 2024, Manila Water Foundation’s
            Integrated WASH program made significant strides in Bulacan,
            Oriental Mindoro, Palawan and Pampanga.

            The <strong>Roots to Shoots-Family Care Center Project</strong> is a
            synergy project with Manila Water Foundation, Pilipinas Shell
            Foundation, and Clark Development Corporation in Mabalacat,
            Pampanga. The consortium’s goal was to improve the water access for
            Aeta households by establishing a deep well facility and protect
            their health

            and well-being. To augment the community's water supply, static
            water tanks were installed in August 2024 with support from Clark
            Water. Realizing the link of WASH to nutrition and livelihoods,
            Manila Water Foundation’s partners provided training sessions for
            the project components on Food Security and Livelihood and the
            Mother-and-Child Care components. Manila Water Foundation led the
            establishment of a WASH group: a community-led leadership council or
            the future water system stewards. Construction of the deep well
            began in December 2024. The Roots to Shoots-Family Care Center
            Project consortium aims to impact 5 local communities with 2,500
            households in the Aeta cultural community.

            <strong>Project Planas</strong> is another synergy initiative by
            Manila Water Foundation with Prime Infra Foundation, Inc. It was
            aimed to close WASH gaps for the Aeta community in the Katutubo
            Village, Barangay Planas in Porac, Pampanga. A water system was
            established for the benefit of 257 households of the residents of
            Sitio Kulambo, Sitio Tanag, and Sitio Magalang. To complement the
            WASH infrastructure and similar in other WASH community partners,
            Manila Water Foundation facilitated capacity- building activities to
            equip and empower community members with knowledge and skills to
            operate and maintain the water system. The WASH Group members,
            comprised mostly by Aeta women, are tasked to lead the management
            and operations of the facility.

            The Filipina Catholic religious congregation of the Religious of the
            Virgin Mary (RVM) was a key project partner that provided the
            permission for the use of the land under which the deep well was
            established. The Barangay Local Government of Planas also supported
            the project through policy development and management.

            The Katutubo Village water system was energized last October 2024
            drawing 300,000 liters of water per day. A conventional water
            treatment system was installed to ensure that the water is compliant
            with the PNSWD (Philippine National Standards for Drinking Water). A
            power reliability function was also installed to ensure steady water
            availability for the community.

              Manila Water Foundation, in partnership with the MWSS, inaugurated
              family toilets in Sitio Sapang Munti, within the Ipo Watershed in
              Norzagaray, Bulacan in November 2024. Thirty (30) sanitation
              facilities now serve over 500 adults and children living in the
              Ipo Watershed. The safe and secure toilets are a vital step in
              eliminating open defecation, protecting the environment, and
              upholding the dignity of families, particularly young girls. The
              handover of the family toilets followed the installation of a
