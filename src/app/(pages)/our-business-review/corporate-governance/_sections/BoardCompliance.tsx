      <p className='mb-4'>
        The Board has an annual evaluation process that is required to be
        accomplished by the directors, which enables an informed and objective
        assessment of the following:
      </p>
      <ol className='styled-list mb-4'>
        <li>Board and Board Committee processes and meetings;</li>
        <li>
          Compliance with the responsibilities and functions of the Board and
          Board Committees;
        </li>
        <li>Board-Management relationship;</li>

          Management
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        This evaluation enables the Board and the Management to determine areas
        that need improvement on the very scope and criteria of the evaluation
        process. It also allows the Board to explain their respective ratings
        and to provide their own comments on the matters discussed in the
        evaluation. The scope and criteria for the Board Evaluation Process is
        contained in the Charter of the Board of Directors. The Charter of the
        Board is available for download at the Company’s website.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        In addition to the annual Board evaluation process, the Audit Committee
        adopted SEC Memorandum Circular No. 4 Series of 2012 on the Guidelines
        for the Assessment of the Performance of Audit Committees of Companies
        Listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange which took effect on June 30,
        2012. Pursuant to this, an annual evaluation is also being conducted to
        assess the performance of the Audit Committee.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        These annual evaluation processes are facilitated by the Office of the
        Corporate Secretary in coordination with the Corporate Governance
        Committee. The Company also engages a third-party evaluator to assess
        the performance of the Board, the Company’s Chairman, and individual
        directors every three years or as needed.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        To determine and measure the effectiveness of the Board of Directors,
        the Company is guided by its Manual on Corporate Governance which is
        available on the Company website:{' '}

      </p>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        The Board has conducted an annual self-assessment of its performance,
        including the performance of its individual members for the year 2024.
        It has also established an internal self-rating and evaluation system.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        For the rating system, rates follow a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being the
        lowest and 5 being the highest. Questionnaires were provided to each of
        the Directors wherein they check for each item the rating that
        corresponds to their personal assessment. An additional portion for
        comments and/or suggestions is also allotted at the end of the
        Questionnaire.

      <h3 className='text-lg font-bold mb-3 mt-8'>
        Office of the Corporate Secretary
      </h3>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        The Corporate Secretary ensures that the Board and the Management follow
        internal and external rules and regulations and facilitates clear
        communications between the Board and Management. More importantly, the
        Company recognizes the mandate of the Office in championing the
        compliance of the Board and the Company with good corporate governance
        practices and policies. For this purpose, the Office of the Corporate
        Secretary, under its Charter, is mandated to coordinate with the Office
        of the Compliance Officer regarding the formulation and implementation
        of the corporate governance practices of the Company, especially those
        relevant to and affecting the Board.
      </p>
      <h3 className='text-lg font-bold mb-3 mt-8'>The Management</h3>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        The Management is primarily responsible in deciding and implementing the
        day-to-day affairs of the Company.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        Management determines the Company’s activities by putting the Company’s
        targets in concrete terms and by formulating the basic strategies for
        achieving these targets.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        Management is primarily accountable to the Board for the operations of
        the Company. As part of its accountability, the Management is required
        to provide the Board with adequate, regular, and timely information on
        the operations and affairs of the Company.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        Reliance on information volunteered by management may not be sufficient
        in all circumstances and further inquiries may have to be made by a
        member of the Board of Directors to enable him to properly perform his
        duties and responsibilities. Hence, the Board should be given
        independent access to the management, the Chief Compliance Officer, the
        Risk Officer, the Internal Audit, External Auditor, and the Corporate
        Secretary.
      </p>

        has adopted a professional development program for employees, officers,
        and senior management. The succession management process has been an
        established practice since the early years of Manila Water and over time
        and has been embedded in leadership responsibilities across the
        organization. It has been a critical enabler of company operations,
        having enabled succession in key leadership positions and mid management
        roles across the organization.

        process to determine the competencies, potential for growth, knowledge,
        and experience necessary for particular roles and positions. This
        enables the company to identify key talents for purposes of succession
        in both leadership and technical roles. The development of a leadership
        and technical talent pool is crucial to the success of Manila Water in
        the future. Hence, it is one of the top strategic priorities of the
        Company. The succession of both leadership and technical talent pool are
        given equal emphasis to ensure that we build the right talents to
        sustain our operations and support our growth. Talents identified to be
